## ðŸš€ NEXT PHASE: Enhanced MAI-DxO Architecture + NextJS Voice Interface Plan

### Objective
Complete MAI-DxO paper architecture with real cost modeling, test result integration, and build a NextJS voice interface using VAPI, Supabase, and Vercel with comprehensive testing and optimized development workflow.

### Development Methodology
#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementation for all components
- Maintain >90% test coverage across all modules
- Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- Automated testing pipeline with CI/CD

#### Git Workflow Strategy
- Create feature branch for each major component/phase
- Comprehensive testing and validation before PR creation
- Code review process for all PRs to master
- Automated testing in PR pipeline

#### Model Configuration
- **Production**: GPT-4 for accuracy and reasoning depth
- **Development/Testing**: GPT-4.1 turbo for low latency and fast iteration
- **Environment-based model switching** via configuration
