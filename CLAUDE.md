# Medical Superintelligence Agent Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Transform the existing LangGraph ReAct agent into a multi-agent medical diagnostic system based on Microsoft's AI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO) research.

## Current Architecture Analysis
- **Base**: Simple ReAct agent with tool calling
- **State**: MessagesAnnotation for conversation history
- **Flow**: callModel → tools → callModel loop
- **Tools**: Currently only Tavily search

## Target Architecture: MAI-DxO System

### 1. Multi-Agent Physician Roles
Replace single agent with 5 specialized physician agents:

#### Dr. Hypothesis (Differential Diagnosis Agent)
- **Role**: Maintains probability-ranked differential diagnoses
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Generate initial diagnostic hypotheses
  - Update probability rankings based on new information
  - Maintain comprehensive differential diagnosis list
- **Implementation**: Specialized prompts and probability tracking logic

#### Dr. Test-Chooser (Diagnostic Test Selection)
- **Role**: Selects optimal diagnostic tests and procedures
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Evaluate diagnostic value of potential tests
  - Consider test accuracy, invasiveness, and availability
  - Recommend next best diagnostic action
- **Implementation**: Test selection algorithms and medical knowledge integration

#### Dr. Challenger (Bias Detection Agent)
- **Role**: Identifies potential diagnostic biases and alternative theories
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Challenge leading diagnoses
  - Identify cognitive biases (anchoring, confirmation bias)
  - Propose alternative diagnostic pathways
- **Implementation**: Adversarial reasoning patterns and bias detection logic

#### Dr. Stewardship (Cost-Conscious Care)
- **Role**: Enforces cost-effective medical decision making
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Track cumulative diagnostic costs
  - Evaluate cost-benefit ratio of tests
  - Recommend cost-effective diagnostic strategies
- **Implementation**: Cost tracking system and economic evaluation tools

#### Dr. Checklist (Quality Control)
- **Role**: Performs systematic quality control and verification
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Verify diagnostic reasoning
  - Ensure systematic approach to diagnosis
  - Final quality check before diagnosis commitment
- **Implementation**: Validation checklists and quality assurance protocols

### 2. State Management Enhancement

#### Extended State Schema
```typescript
interface MedicalDiagnosticState {
  // Existing message history
  messages: AIMessage[];
  
  // Medical diagnostic state
  differentialDiagnoses: DiagnosisHypothesis[];
  availableCaseInfo: CaseInformation;
  revealedInformation: string[];
  diagnosticTests: TestResult[];
  cumulativeCost: number;
  costBudget: number;
  
  // Workflow state
  currentPhase: 'information_gathering' | 'test_selection' | 'deliberation' | 'final_diagnosis';
  debateRound: number;
  agentTurns: AgentTurn[];
  
  // Decision tracking
  confidenceLevel: number;
  readyForDiagnosis: boolean;
}
```

#### Key Data Structures
- **DiagnosisHypothesis**: Condition name, probability, supporting evidence
- **CaseInformation**: Patient history, symptoms, demographics (gatekeeper controlled)
- **TestResult**: Test type, result, cost, diagnostic value
- **AgentTurn**: Agent role, reasoning, recommendations

### 3. Workflow Implementation

#### Chain of Debate Process
1. **Information Gathering Phase**
   - Dr. Hypothesis generates initial differential diagnoses
   - Gatekeeper reveals minimal case information
   - Agents request additional information

2. **Test Selection Phase**
   - Dr. Test-Chooser evaluates diagnostic options
   - Dr. Stewardship reviews cost implications
   - Dr. Challenger questions test necessity

3. **Deliberation Phase**
   - All agents participate in structured debate
   - Update differential diagnoses based on new information
   - Dr. Checklist validates reasoning

4. **Decision Phase**
   - Evaluate diagnostic confidence
   - Decide: continue investigation vs. commit to diagnosis
   - Dr. Stewardship final cost-benefit analysis

#### Gatekeeper Pattern
- **Purpose**: Simulate real-world information acquisition
- **Implementation**: Selective information revelation based on agent requests
- **Benefits**: Prevents information overload, mimics clinical workflow

### 4. Tools and Components

#### Medical Diagnostic Tools
- **DiagnosticTestSelector**: Recommends appropriate tests based on symptoms
- **CostEstimator**: Calculates diagnostic test costs and total expenses
- **DifferentialDiagnosisRanker**: Ranks diagnoses by probability

### 7. Testing Strategy

#### Medical Case Simulation
- **Synthetic Cases**: Generate test cases with known diagnoses
- **Real Cases**: Use anonymized medical case studies
- **Validation**: Compare agent diagnoses with expert opinions

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Interactive Patient Consultation

### Patient Follow-Up Interrupt Logic Implementation

I've successfully implemented the interrupt logic for patient follow-up questions in the medical diagnostic agent. Here's what was delivered:

#### Key Features Implemented

**1. Enhanced State Management** (medical_state.ts:83-114)
- Added `PatientQuestion` and `PatientResponse` interfaces
- Extended state with patient interaction tracking
- Added `patient_interaction` phase to workflow

**2. Patient Question Agent** (patient_question_agent.ts)
- Generates targeted follow-up questions based on diagnostic gaps
- Uses AI to create contextually relevant questions
- Prioritizes questions by diagnostic value
- Detects when questions are needed (low confidence, competing diagnoses)

**3. Enhanced Gatekeeper** (gatekeeper.ts:400-546)
- Processes user responses and updates case information
- Extracts structured data from free-text responses
- Merges new information with existing case data
- Validates response completeness

**4. Interrupt Workflow** (medical_graph.ts:70-143, 227-274)
- Added `patient_interaction` and `process_user_response` nodes
- Configured `interruptBefore: ["patient_interaction"]` at line 364
- Updated routing logic to trigger interrupts when questions needed
- Creates proper workflow pauses for user input

#### How It Works

1. **Question Generation**: When agents need more information (confidence <60%, competing diagnoses, explicit requests), the `PatientQuestionAgent` generates 3-5 targeted questions

2. **Workflow Interrupt**: The graph hits `patient_interaction` node and stops execution (`interruptBefore`) when questions are pending

3. **User Response**: User provides answers, which are processed by the enhanced `CaseInformationGatekeeper`

4. **Information Integration**: Responses are structured and merged into the case information using AI extraction

5. **Continued Analysis**: Workflow resumes with enhanced information for better diagnostic accuracy

#### Example Question Types Generated
- **Timeline**: "When did your symptoms first begin?"
- **Symptom Details**: "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your pain?"
- **Medical History**: "Are you currently taking any medications?"
- **Associated Symptoms**: "Any recent fever or chills?"

The implementation transforms the self-contained looping agent into an interactive diagnostic consultation that mirrors the MAI-DxO pattern of sequential, question-driven information gathering. The system now pauses at appropriate points to seek additional patient information, preventing endless internal loops and enabling a more realistic diagnostic workflow.
